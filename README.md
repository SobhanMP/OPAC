# OPAC: Optimal Packet over Avian Carriers



The complete rapport is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SobhanMP/OPAC/master/report/pigeon.pdf). It contains all of the detail, formulation, methodology, problem definition, simulation.
Long story short, we want to use pigeons to improve the efficiency of mesh networks (IP networks with loops). I defined the problem, simulated the data, and solved the problem with Benders decomposition and Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition.
